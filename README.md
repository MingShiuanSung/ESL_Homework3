# Sobel Edge Detector

This is a introduction to compile HW3 files. <br>

## Introduction
This project contains a Gaussion filter module connected to Testbench module using stratus hls. <br>

## Compilation
1. For example, if we want to run behavioral simulation.
<br>
    cd ./stratus
<br>
    $ make sim_B
<br>

2. Run synthesis and Verilog simulation with HLS configuration BASIC.
<br>
    $ make sim_V_BASIC
<br>

The result image "out.bmp" will be saved at ./stratus, and the elapsed time will be shown on the terminal. <br>
